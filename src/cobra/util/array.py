    The algorithm used by this function is based on the singular value
    decomposition of `A`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : numpy.ndarray
        A should be at most 2-D.  A 1-D array with length k will be treated
        as a 2-D with shape (1, k)
    atol : float
        The absolute tolerance for a zero singular value.  Singular values
        smaller than `atol` are considered to be zero.
    rtol : float
        The relative tolerance.  Singular values less than rtol*smax are
        considered to be zero, where smax is the largest singular value.

    If both `atol` and `rtol` are positive, the combined tolerance is the
    maximum of the two; that is::
    tol = max(atol, rtol * smax)
    Singular values smaller than `tol` are considered to be zero.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        If `A` is an array with shape (m, k), then `ns` will be an array
        with shape (k, n), where n is the estimated dimension of the
        nullspace of `A`.  The columns of `ns` are a basis for the
        nullspace; each element in numpy.dot(A, ns) will be approximately
        zero.

    -----
    Taken from the numpy cookbook.

    bounds for the complete problem.

    Notes
    -----
    To accomodate non-zero equalities the problem will add the variable
    "const_one" which is a variable that equals one.

    Arguments
    ---------
    model : cobra.Model
        The model from which to obtain the LP problem.
    array_type : string

    zero_tol : float
        The zero tolerance used to judge whether two bounds are the same.

    Returns
    -------
    collections.namedtuple
        A named tuple consisting of 6 matrices and 2 vectors:
        - "equalities" is a matrix S such that S*vars = b. It includes a row
          for each constraint and one column for each variable.
        - "b" the right side of the equality equation such that S*vars = b.
        - "inequalities" is a matrix M such that lb <= M*vars <= ub.
          It contains a row for each inequality and as many columns as
          variables.
        - "bounds" is a compound matrix [lb ub] containing the lower and
          upper bounds for the inequality constraints in M.
        - "variable_fixed" is a boolean vector indicating whether the variable
          at that index is fixed (lower bound == upper_bound) and
          is thus bounded by an equality constraint.
        - "variable_bounds" is a compound matrix [lb ub] containing the
          lower and upper bounds for all variables.
